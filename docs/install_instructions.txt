=== Install Instructions ===

This app is designed to run with the branch version of 1.2

The user system is linked to the bakery, it's therefore a good idea to have
a working http://cakeforge.org/projects/bakery/ install first.

== DB setup ==
if you have a working bakery install
        create the book database and tables using either the schema.php or schema.sql file
        create your databse.php file with a default and bakery pointing at
        their respective databases
if you don't have or don't want to install the bakery
        create an empty database and fill it with the complete.sql file
        create your databse.php file with a default and bakery pointing at the
        same database

== Config setup ==
Create a core.php file, or copy from a stock 1.2 install
Create a database.php file naming the database with a default and bakery
connection

== Creating your initial data ==
On first load, the book will populate itself with some test data if the database is empty and debug mode is enabled
Therefore, to start your book experience - create or empty the database and
simply browse
