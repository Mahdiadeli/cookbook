=== Install Instructions ===

This app is designed to run with the branch version of 1.2

The user system is linked to the bakery, it's therefore a good idea to have
a working http://cakeforge.org/projects/bakery/ install first. 

== DB setup ==
create the book database and tables using either the schema.php or schema.sql file
Add the sample data from the config/sql folder
if you haven't installed the bakery code, you at least need to create the user
table from the bakery schema

== Config setup ==
Create a core.php file, or copy from a stock 1.2 install
Create a database.php file naming the database with a default and bakery
connection
